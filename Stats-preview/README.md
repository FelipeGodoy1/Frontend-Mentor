# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component

![Design preview for the Stats preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hello this is my solution to the [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)

## The challenge ðŸš€

This is a great small challenge to help get you used to building to a  design. There's no JS in this project, so you'll be able to focus on  your HTML & CSS skills.

Your challenge is to build out this card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## Tecnologies used ðŸ”¥

- HTML5
- CSS
